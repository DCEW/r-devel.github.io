## Translating R to your Language

Prepared by Michael Chirico and Michael Lawrence.

R users are a global bunch. Providing error messages in languages besides English can greatly improve the user experience (and debugging experience) of those using R who may not be English natives.

The standard tools for providing translations can be somewhat esoteric; this tutorial goes over some of the challenges presented by translations, the process for providing and/or updating translations to R itself, and finally introduces a package (`potools`) that will remove some of the frictions potential translators may face.

Recording and slides are available:
