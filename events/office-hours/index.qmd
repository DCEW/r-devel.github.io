<br>Join an Office Hour to

-   discuss how to get started contributing to R;
-   get help/feedback on contributions you are working on;
-   look at open bugs/work on translations together.

## What happens at an office hour?

The Office Hours are facilitated by members of the R Contribution Working Group who will tailor the hour according to the interests of attendees. The hour might include brief overviews or mini demonstrations, live debugging or discussion of different topics. Participants may be asked to add to a collaborative document or share their screen. All participation is optional - it is fine to come along and observe. You can check out the [office hour minutes](https://github.com/r-devel/rcwg/tree/main/office_hours) to see what we've been up to recently.

## Who should come to office hours?

We welcome people that are entirely new to contributing as well as seasoned contributors.

## When are the office hours?

The Office Hours are typically held on the **2nd Thursday of the month**, at two times to cater for different world regions (click to find the corresponding time in your local time zone):
