# Collaboration Campfires

The Collaboration Campfires are online collaborative events to open pathways for members of groups currently underrepresented in the R project. The goal is to demystify the R development process and highlight ways that R programmers can contribute, with a focus on low-level contributions in terms of time commitment and prerequisite knowledge.

The current series is planned in the run-up to the [useR! 2022](https://user2022.r-project.org/) online conference, where we plan to hold a global contribution event!
