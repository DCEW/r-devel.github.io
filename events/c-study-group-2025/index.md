# C Study Group for R Contributors 2025

This is a study group meeting once a month for existing/aspiring R contributors who want to gain/refresh basic skills in C programming.

It will run from **February to July 2025**.

## Study materials

The main study materials are from the C sessions of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science. This will be supplemented with a chapter from [Deep R Programming](https://deepr.gagolewski.com/chapter/310-compiled.html) on R's C API.

## Schedule

The study group will typically meet in the last week of the month.

## Commitment

Participants should study the material and attempt the corresponding exercises before each study group meeting.

A suggested weekly schedule for each month for the CS50 material is:

-   Week 1: Watch "Lecture" video (2.5 hr)
-   Week 2: Watch "Shorts" (\~6 x 10-15 min videos that expand on topics in the lecture) and do one or more of the [additional practice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/practice/) problems for the corresponding week
-   Week 3: Watch "Section" (~1hr video going beyond the lecture) and do one or more of the remaining additional practice problems
-   Week 4: Meet to share solutions to the practice problems. Optional: Do "Problem Set" and submit if doing course for credit, or if you want to receive an automatic grade to check your progress

The additional practice problems are often harder than the problem set, 
however we suggest leaving the problem set till after the meetup and attempting 
this independently (this is expected if you are doing the course for credit).

There is the option to do further study towards a free [certificate](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/certificate/) from Harvard or a verified certificate from edX (~200 USD, financial assistance program available on edX). See the CS50 website for details.

At study group meetings, participants should be prepared to share and discuss their work on the exercises.


## Sessions

The study group will meet once a month. 
To accommodate participants in a wide range of time-zones, the C Study Group will run in three cohorts. 

- Cohort 1: 20:00-21:00 (London) / 12:00-13:00 (San Francisco), last **Tuesday** of the month (Feb 25th, Mar 25th, Apr 29th, May 27th, Jun 24th, Jul 29th)

- Cohort 2: At a time designed to be convenient for Australia. Exact time and dates TBC. This cohort will likely start May or June.

- Cohort 3: 15:00-16:00 (London) / 10:00-11:00 (New York), last **Friday** for the month (Feb 28th, Mar 28th, Apr 25th, May 30th, Jun 27th, Jul 25th)

Note that the London times are GMT/UTC in winter and BST in summer, so please take care if/when the clocks change in your time zone. The [events](/events) page shows actual times in your time zone, along with Google calendar and iCalendar links (the time zone on the calendar can be selected in its bottom-right corner).

Sign up to attend the sessions on the [R Contributors Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/r-contributors/events/).

Sessions will be recorded and shared on on the [R Contributors Slack](/slack) for people that can't make the meetings. 


## Further help

Participants are encouraged to join the #c-study-group channel on the [R Contributors Slack](/slack) to discuss with others as they work through the material. CS50 also has [communities](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/communities/) on multiple platforms that you can connect to.
