# C Study Group for R Contributors 2025

This is a study group meeting once a month for existing/aspiring R contributors that want to gain/refresh basic skills in C programming.

It will run from **February to July 2025**.

## Study materials

The main study materials are from the C sessions of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science. This will be supplemented with a chapter from [Deep R Programming](https://deepr.gagolewski.com/chapter/310-compiled.html) on R's C API.

## Schedule

**Note: this schedule will be updated with the exact dates once they have been decided (see 'Timing' section below). Links will also be updated to the 2025 material once released.**

## Commitment

Participants should study the material and attempt the corresponding exercises before each study group meeting.

A suggested weekly schedule for each month for the CS50 material is:

-   Week 1: Watch "Lecture" video (2.5 hr)
-   Week 2: Watch "Shorts" (\~6 x 10-15 min videos that expand on topics in the lecture) and do one or more of the [additional practice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/practice/) problems for the corresponding week
-   Week 3: Watch "Section" (~1hr video going beyond the lecture) and do one or more of the remaining additional practice problems
-   Week 4: Meet to share solutions to the practice problems. Optional: Do "Problem Set" and submit if doing course for credit, or if you want to receive an automatic grade to check your progress

The additional practice problems are often harder than the problem set, 
however we suggest leaving the problem set till after the meetup and attempting 
this independently (this is expected if you are doing the course for credit).

There is the option to do further study towards a free [certificate](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/certificate/) from Harvard or a verified certificate from edX (~200 USD, financial assistance program available on edX). See the CS50 website for details.

At study group meetings, participants should be prepared to share and discuss their work on the exercises.

## Timing

The book club will typically meet in the 4th week of the month, from February to July 2025.

**In order to determine the best time (or two) to hold the meetings, if you are interested in attending, please fill out [this whenisgood poll](https://whenisgood.net/jqfrg3j) with your availability by MONDAY JANUARY 20TH 2025, 11PM UTC.** 

**This page will be updated later that week with the chosen day/time(s).**

In due course, the [events](/events) page will be updated with actual times in your time zone, along with Google calendar and iCalendar links.

Sign up to attend the sessions on the [R Contributors Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/r-contributors/events/).

Sessions will be recorded and shared on on the [R Contributors Slack](/slack) for people that can't make the meetings.

## Further help

Participants are encouraged to join the #c-study-group channel on the [R Contributors Slack](/slack) to discuss with others as they work through the material. CS50 also has [communities](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/communities/) on multiple platforms that you can connect to.
