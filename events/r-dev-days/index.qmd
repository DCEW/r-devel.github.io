R Dev Days are short events - usually over one day, or linked sessions over 
consecutive days - for novice and experienced contributors to work 
collaboratively on contributions to base R. These events have the support of 
the R Core Team and some will have R Core Developers participating directly.

## What happens at an R Dev Day?

Tasks are prepared in the run-up to the event, but commonly include:

 * Reviewing, analysing and fixing code or documentation bugs reported on Râ€™s [Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org/).
 * Contributing to message translations via [Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/).

Tasks may also relate to contributor infrastructure, such as the 
[R Dev Guide](../rdevguide) and the [R Dev Container](../r-dev-container).

## Who can take part?

Some events have open registration, whilst others have an application process 
to ensure a balance of experience levels over limited places.

R Dev Days are usually run as satellite events to a conference, with 
registration/application open to people outside the conference.

The main criteria for participation is a good knowledge of R programming and a 
keen interest in contributing, as we hope participants continue to contribute 
after the event. 

## How much does it cost?

R Dev Days are free to attend and we are usually able to provide lunch and 
refreshments to particpants. We will advertise when additional support is 
available (e.g. through scholarships to the associated conference).

Each event will have a ticket site or web page with more information - see the 
[Upcoming events](#upcoming-events) section or the 
[R Contributor Events Page](..).
