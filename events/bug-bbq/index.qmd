## Session format

Each session is self-guided, to allow people to get started whenever they can join.

When you join:

1. [Optional, for new contributors] Watch the abridged version of the [Contributing to R tutorial](https://youtu.be/tsymQiL2BY0) from useR! 2021 (~1.5 hours). 
At least one of the tutors, Gabriel Becker and Martin MÃ¤chler, will be available for questions in each of the sessions.
2. Watch the [Welcome to the Bug BBQ](https://youtu.be/sJpOxViQdm8) video to get orientated. [Corresponding HTML slides](welcome) - press P to see the transcript.
3. Use the remaining time to work independently or in small groups on open bugs.
 - Zoom breakout rooms will be available for people that want to work together.
 - The #bug-bbq channel on the [R Contributors Slack](../slack) will be used for people that want to chat.
 - The [bug-bbq GitHub repo](https://github.com/r-devel/bug-bbq) will be used to track progress.
 
Note: we will be treating the R Bugzilla as **read only** during the event. Please do not post there, but rather use the Zoom, Slack or GitHub repo mentioned above.
