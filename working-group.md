# R Contribution Working Group

The R Contribution Working Group is a collaboration between R Core, R community groups (including [Forwards](https://forwards.github.io/), the [R Community Diversity and Inclusion Working Group](https://github.com/RConsortium/RCDI-WG/tree/master), [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/), [MiR](https://mircommunity.com/)) and members of the wider R community. Its aim is to encourage new contributors to R core, with a focus on diversity and inclusion.

## Current Work

The group maintains a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution), with issues relating to current initiatives and related documents, such as minutes of meetings.

## Get Involved

Anyone from the R community that supports the group's objectives and would like to contribute is welcome to get involved. This can range from commenting on GitHub issues to actively working on initiatives.

Stay up-to-date with RCWG meeting announcements in one of the following ways:
 - Go to the [Events](events) page and add the event series to your calendar
 - Email [rowforwards@gmail.com](mailto:rowforwards@gmail.com) to be added to/removed from the mailing list to receive meeting invitations.

Several members of the working group are also on the [R Contributors Slack](slack) and discuss issues relevant to outreach on the `#core-outreach` channel.
