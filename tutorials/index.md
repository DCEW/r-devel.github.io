## Contributing to R

*Gabriel Becker and Martin Maechler, useR! 2021.*

Did you always want to contribute to (base) R but don't know how?

This tutorial shows cases where and how users have contributed actively to (base) R, by submitting bug reports with minimal reproducible examples, how testing, reading source code, and providing patches to the R source code has helped making R better.

A selection of past bug reports are provided for you to practice debugging. For bugs that have been resolved you can check what happened after the bug was reported.

[Contributing to R tutorial](contributing-to-r): 2h15 video (or 1h30 abridged version), with accompanying slides and exercises.

## Translating R to your Language

*Michael Chirico and Michael Lawrence, useR! 2021.*

R users are a global bunch. Providing error messages in languages besides English can greatly improve the user experience (and debugging experience) of those using R who may not be English natives.

The standard tools for providing translations can be somewhat esoteric; this tutorial goes over some of the challenges presented by translations, the process for providing and/or updating translations to R itself, and finally introduces a package (`potools`) that will remove some of the frictions potential translators may face.
