There is no cost to attend. Registration can be done any time up to the end of each session and allows you to join the Zoom meeting to chat with facilitators and other participants.

## Session format

Each session is self-guided, to allow people to get started whenever they can join.

When you join: (links to videos to be added)

1. [Optional, for new contributors] Watch the Contributing to R tutorial video from useR! 2021 (1.5 hours). 
At least one of the tutors, Gabriel Becker and Martin MÃ¤chler, will be available for questions in each of the sessions.
2. Watch the Welcome to Bug BBQ video to get orientated.
3. Use the remaining time to work independently or in small groups on open bugs.
 - Zoom breakout rooms will be available for people that want to work together.
 - The #bug-bbq channel on the [R-Devel Slack](../slack) will be used for people that want to chat (this channel is not yet open).
 - The [bug-bbq GitHub repo](https://github.com/r-devel/bug-bbq) will be used to track progress.
 
Note: we will be treating the R Bugzilla as **read only** during the event. Please do not post there, but rather use the Zoom, Slack or GitHub repo mentioned above.
