# R Contribution Working Group

The R Contribution Working Group is a collaboration between R Core, R community groups (including [Forwards](https://forwards.github.io/), the [R Community Diversity and Inclusion Working Group](https://github.com/RConsortium/RCDI-WG/tree/master), [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/), [MiR](https://mircommunity.com/)) and members of the wider R community. Its aim is to encourage new contributors to R core, with a focus on diversity and inclusion.

## Current Work

The group maintains a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution), with issues relating to current initiatives and related documents, such as minutes of meetings. Dates of upcoming meetings are posted there, as well as on the [Events](events) page here.

## Get Involved

Anyone from the R community that supports the group's objectives and would like to contribute is welcome to get involved. This can range from commenting on GitHub issues to actively working on initiatives. The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution) has more details, including how to join the mailing list to be invited to group meetings.

Several members of the working group are also on the [R Contributors Slack](slack) and discuss issues relevant to outreach on the `#core-outreach` channel.
