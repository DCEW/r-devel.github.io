It is a satellite event to [useR! 2022](https://user2022.r-project.org/), however you do not need to register for useR! to attend the Bug BBQ.

## Schedule

There will be three organized sessions during the event and people are welcome to attend one or more session.
The three sessions are suited to different regions of the globe, as detailed below.

There is no cost to attend - details of how to join the Zoom sessions will be added in due course. 

## Session format

Each session is self-guided, to allow people to get started whenever they can join.

When you join: (links to videos to be added)

1. [Optional, for new contributors] Watch the Contributing to R tutorial video from useR! 2021 (1.5 hours). 
At least one of the tutors, Gabriel Becker and Martin MÃ¤chler, will be available for questions in each of the sessions.
2. Watch the Welcome to Bug BBQ video to get orientated.
3. Use the remaining time to work independently or in small groups on open bugs.
 - Zoom breakout rooms will be available for people that want to work together.
 - The #bug-bbq channel on the [R-Devel Slack](../slack) will be used for people that want to chat (this channel is not yet open).
 - The [bug-bbq GitHub repo](https://github.com/r-devel/bug-bbq) will be used to track progress.
 
Note: we will be treating the R Bugzilla as **read only** during the event. Please do not post there, but rather use the Zoom, Slack or GitHub repo mentioned above.
