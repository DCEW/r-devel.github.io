## Translating R to your Language

Prepared by Michael Chirico and Michael Lawrence.

R users are a global bunch. Providing error messages in languages besides English can greatly improve the user experience (and debugging experience) of those using R who may not be English natives.

In this video tutorial recorded at useR! 2021, Michael Chirico and Michael Lawrence aim to get package developers and other R community members started implementing foreign-language translations of R's messages (errors, warnings, verbose output, etc.) into a language of their choosing.

The standard tools for providing translations can be somewhat esoteric; this tutorial goes over some of the challenges presented by translations, the process for providing and/or updating translations to R itself, and finally introduces a package (`potools`) that will remove some of the frictions potential translators may face.
