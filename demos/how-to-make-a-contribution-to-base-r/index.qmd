The [presentation slides](https://hturner.github.io/contributing-demo/) are available in HTML format - press `S` to view with speaker notes (the video text). 

*Note: This demo introduces a basic workflow for simple fixes. For more complex work on internal R functions or compiled code (e.g. involving the C code underlying much of base R), it will be necessary to build R to develop and test your patch. Refer to the R Development Guide for more information on [building R from source](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/GetStart.html) and [the lifecycle of a patch](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/FixBug.html).*
