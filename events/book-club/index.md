# C book club for R contributors

This is a book club meeting every two weeks for existing/aspiring R contributors that want to learn/refresh their C programming skills.

It will run from May to August 2023, so that people attending R Project Sprint 2023 have at least a basic understanding of C and how it interfaces with R. 
However, you do not have to be a sprint participant to join the book club!

## Readings

Our main reading will be [Modern C](https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/modern-c/) by Jens Gustedt. A PDF is available for free download, or there is a 35% discount code for a print or eBook copy (see the [Modern C](https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/modern-c/) website). This book is organized in levels: 

 - **0 - Encounter:** summarizes the very basics of programming with C.
 - **1 - Acquaintance:** details most principal concepts and features such as control structures, data types, operators, and functions.
 - **2 - Cognition:** goes to the heart of the C language, covering pointers, C’s memory model, and most of C’s library interface. 
 - **3 - Experience:** goes into detail about specific topics, such as performance, reentrancy, atomicity, threads, and type-generic programming. 
 
This book club will cover **levels 0 to 2** (about 200 pages).
 
The reading will be supplemented with:

 - Selected exercises from [C Programming: A Modern Approach](http://knking.com/books/c2/) by K. N. King (shared under fair use).
 - The [chapter on R's C interface](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/C-interface.html) from Advanced R (1st ed.) by Hadley Wickham (free online).

## Commitment

There are three levels of commitment:

- **Low (1-2 hrs/wk):** Read the assigned readings, work through the examples in the main text and participate in the online meetings every two weeks.
- **Medium (2-3 hrs/wk, recommended):** Same as Low, but also try (some of) the selected exercises.
- **High (~1 day/wk):** Same as Medium, but also try (some of) the challenges in Modern C.

At the online meetings, one book club member will present a summary of the chapter (~10 minutes), reviewing the main points and highlighting any quotes/examples they found particularly helpful/important. This will be followed by discussion, sharing exercise solutions, etc. 
Book club members are encouraged to sign up to present at one session to spread the load among the group.

## Timing

The book club will meet in two cohorts:

-   **Cohort 1:** 12 noon - 1 pm UTC ([find 12 noon UTC in your local time](https://everytimezone.com/s/b3dd06ec)).
-   **Cohort 2:** 7 pm - 8 pm PDT ([find 7 pm PDT in your local time](https://everytimezone.com/s/69c81481))

Sign-up to attend the sessions on the [R Contributors Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/r-contributors/events/).
